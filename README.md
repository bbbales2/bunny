I think tests should be runnable with:

```
poetry install
poetry run pytest tests
```

No guarantee the tests pass every time, stuff being random and all.

I think I installed poetry with `pip install poetry`. I forget. It's a package management tool. Check [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer) for install directions.
